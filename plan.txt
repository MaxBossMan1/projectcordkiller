Okay, let's outline an MVP plan focusing on your core privacy and security principles with your chosen tech stack. The goal is a functional, secure base that can be built upon.

Given your choice of server-routed real-time communications for privacy (avoiding P2P), this means voicevideo will need a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) or similar media server, and text chat will be relayed through your backend.

Tech Stack Summary

    Frontend React (TypeScript)
    Desktop App Electron
    Backend Node.js (TypeScript) with Express.js or Fastify
    Real-time (Text) WebSockets (e.g., ws library or Socket.IO on Node.js)
    Real-time (Voice) WebRTC with LiveKit SFU (open-source, production-ready SFU with simple deployment)
    Database PostgreSQL
    Deployment Google Cloud

Phase 1 Core Secure Text Communication & Foundation

This phase focuses on getting the absolute essentials for secure text chat and user management up and running.

Features

    Secure User Authentication & Management
        User registration (email, strong hashed password using Argon2 or bcrypt).
        Email verification.
        Secure login.
        Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using TOTP (e.g., speakeasy, otplib libraries). This is crucial for a security-focused app.
        Basic user profiles (username, avatar - keep data minimal).
        Ability to delete account (and associated data).
    Server & Channel Structure
        Users can create Servers (or your chosen term for communities).
        Within Servers, users can create text Channels.
        Basic server settings (name, icon).
    Secure Text Chat
        Real-time text messaging in Channels (relayed via WebSocket server).
        End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) Direct Messages (DMs) between two users using Signal Protocol. This is a key feature for your privacy focus.
            Signal Protocol provides proven security with Double Ratchet algorithm for forward secrecy and post-compromise security. Use libsignal-protocol-javascript for implementation.
        Group DMs (initially, these might not be E2EE due to complexity, but this should be clearly communicated; server-side encryption at rest and in transit is a must).
        Basic message formatting (markdown subset).
        Message history (with clear user controls for deletion, especially in DMs).
        Typing indicators, read receipts (make these toggleable for privacy).
    Roles & Basic Permissions (Simplified)
        Server Owner (creator).
        Admin (can manage channels, users).
        Member.
        Simple invite system (e.g., unique, expiring links).
    Electron Desktop Application
        Packaging of the React web application.
        Basic auto-update mechanism (e.g., electron-updater).
    Privacy Dashboard
        A simple in-app section explaining data handling practices, what's encrypted, what's collected (and why it's minimal).

Technical Implementation Notes for Phase 1

    Backend API for user auth, serverchannel management, WebSocket server for text chat relay and E2EE signaling for DMs.
    Database PostgreSQL schemas for users, servers, channels, messages (encrypted at rest), E2EE keysmetadata for DMs (handled carefully).
    Security HTTPS for all communication, secure password hashing, input validation, rate limiting.

Phase 2 Server-Routed Voice Chat & Polish

This phase introduces secure voice communication and refines the existing features.

Features

    Secure Voice Chat (Server-Routed)
        Voice channels within Servers.
        WebRTC for audio transport, but all media routed through your SFU.
        The SFU manages media streams, reducing client load and hiding IP addresses.
        Voice activity indicators.
        Mute selfothers (for admins), deafen.
        Encryption in transit for voice (DTLS-SRTP, standard with WebRTC and SFUs).
    Enhanced UIUX
        Refine the user interface based on early feedback.
        Improve accessibility.
    Strengthened Security & Privacy Features
        Implement more granular privacy settings.
        Review and harden all security aspects.
    Basic Moderation Tools
        Kickban users from a server (by OwnerAdmin).

Technical Implementation Notes for Phase 2

    SFU Implementation
        LiveKit SFU Chosen for simplicity and production-readiness. Open-source, single binary deployment, excellent documentation.
        LiveKit provides REST API for room management that integrates cleanly with your Node.js backend.
        Deploy on GKE (containerized) or Compute Engine for full control over infrastructure.
        Your backend handles room creation via LiveKit's REST API and manages user admission to voice channels.
        Built-in TURN server functionality and proper WebRTC encryption (DTLS-SRTP).

Google Cloud Deployment Strategy for MVP

    Compute
        Backend API & WebSocket Server
            Cloud Run Ideal for stateless HTTP services and can handle WebSockets. Pay-per-use, scales to zero. Good for starting.
        SFU (Voice Server)
            Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) If you containerize your SFU (e.g., Mediasoup in Docker), GKE provides robust orchestration, scaling, and networking.
            Alternatively, Compute Engine (GCE) VMs If you prefer more direct control over the SFU environment. You'll need to manage OS, networking, etc.
    Database
        Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL Fully managed, handles backups, updates, replication.
    Storage
        Cloud Storage For static assets (React app build files), user avatars (if any), and potentially for storing E2EE encrypted attachments in the future.
    Networking
        Cloud Load Balancing To distribute traffic to your Cloud Run services and GKEGCE instances. Essential for HTTPS termination and reliability.
        Cloud DNS For managing your application's domain.
        VPC Network & Firewall Rules To create a secure network for your backend services and database, restricting access appropriately.
    Container Management
        Artifact Registry (or Google Container Registry - gcr.io) To store your Docker images for Cloud Run and GKE.
    Identity (Consider)
        Identity Platform (Firebase Auth backend) While you can build your own auth, Identity Platform provides a secure, managed solution for user authentication, including 2FA, which can offload significant security burdens. It integrates well with other Google Cloud services.
    Operations
        Cloud Logging & Cloud Monitoring For application logs, performance metrics, and alerting.

Privacy & Security Implementation Notes for MVP

    Data Minimization Only collect absolutely essential user data.
    Encryption
        HTTPS everywhere.
        Data at rest encryption for PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL handles this).
        E2EE for DMs (client-side logic, secure key exchange).
        DTLS-SRTP for voice chat via SFU.
    Code Audits (Post-MVP) Plan for security audits, especially around cryptographic implementations.
    Transparency Clearly document your privacy and security practices for users.

This MVP plan provides a solid foundation. The E2EE for DMs and the SFU setup for voice are the most complex parts but are critical for your stated goals. Good luck!
